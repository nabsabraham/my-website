I am a MLE at [Cohere](https://cohere.com/) where I'm privileged to work with NLP pros in the field! My day-to-day involves building tools/pipelines that will better our LLM products. My past experience includes building MLOps pipelines at [Covera Health](https://www.coverahealth.com/) and getting knee-deep in healthcare data as a Data Scientist at Loblaw Companies Limited. My prior research roles include Research Associate at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute supervised by [Dr. Farzad Khalvati](https://sites.google.com/site/farzadkhalvati/) where I worked on medical image analysis problems using deep learning and several applied research assistant roles within the aerospace, robotics and biology departments in my undergrad. I graduated from the [Ryerson Multimedia Lab](https://www.ryerson.ca/multimedia-research-laboratory/) supervised by [Dr. Naimul Khan](https://www.ee.ryerson.ca/people/NKhan.html). My graduate thesis research focused on improved medical image segmentation practices via a new objective function and a new multi-modal architecture.
